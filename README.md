#Dive Into Elm
Take a deep dive into Elm and Functional Programming (part of the [Sweet Libs Lab][1] from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.

## Objective: Learn how to learn something new
Disclaimer! I don't know JavaScript all that well...yet! But, I was encouraged after reading this [Metal Toad blog post][2] and speaking to an instructor to go ahead and jump in.

## My Goal: Research, write, and present something about Elm and Functional Programming.
## Schedule:
- 11AM - research Functional Programming in web development
- 12PM - research Elm
- 1PM - determine something to build based on research
- 2:45 PM - Put together presentation notes(results) and resources used
- 3:30 PM - Share with class

## Results

### Functional Programming
- What is it?
- Now that we've learned what we've learned in WDI, how does in relate?
- How can I add new languages and patterns on top of this foundation?
- How does it compare to Object Oriented Programming?
